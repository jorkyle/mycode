# mycode: A Work In Progress

With this project, I'm just learning the ropes of version control with GitHub.

## Getting Started

As of now, my code repo isn't capable of much.  But it will be someday.

### Prerequisites

python3

```
sudo apt-get install python3
```

### Installing

Right now, just download the script and run it from shell.  It doesn't really do anything.  Navigate to the download directory and run it like this:

```
python3 input_ip.py
```

Output is as follows...

```
Please enter and IPv4 IP Address: 10.10.10.10
You told me the IPv4 address is: 10.10.10.10
```

That's it, that's all.

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system. We don't have any, so just make a note that they are none at this time.

## Deployment

Here we might put additional notes about how to deploy on various systems. For now, put a note that we're testing our code on Linux Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The coding language used

## Contributing

Here you could make notes about how others might contribute to your code. For right now, a friendly message saying you'll accept any and all help from other coders would be great!
