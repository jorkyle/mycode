# mycode: A Work In Progress

With this project, I'm just learning the ropes of version control with GitHub.

## Getting Started

As of now, my code repo isn't capable of much.  But it will be someday.

### Prerequisites

Python 3

For installation binaries, download from the following link:
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-365/

Or you can install from CLI:
```
sudo apt-get install python3
```

### Installing

Right now, just download the scripts and run from shell. They each have a small job/demonstrate basic functions. Navigate to the appropriate directory and run a script like this:

```
python3 [script_name].py
```

That's it, that's all.

## Running the tests

Eventually I will explain how to run the automated tests for this system. We don't have any at this time.

## Deployment

Testing with Python 3.6.5 under GNU bash, version 3.2.57(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin16).
